# Hero generator build with **React.js** and **Typescript**.

This project is the **React.js** implementation of [@Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)'s [Hero Generator](https://github.com/sdras/hero-generator) which was originally built with Vue.js.
**[Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce)** for **React.js**, **Typescript**, **React.js**'s (_Custom Hooks_, _Context API_) are used to build the project. Enjoy! :).
